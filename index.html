<h1 class = "heading"> What is Python? Everything you need to know! </h1>
<p class = "paragraph"> Dating from 1991, the Python programming language was considered a gap-filler, a way to write scripts
  that “automate the boring stuff” (as one popular book on learning Python put it) or to rapidly prototype
  applications that will be implemented in other languages.</p>

<p class = "paragraph">  However, over the past few years,Python has emerged as a first-class citizen in modern software development,
  infrastructure management, and data analysis.It is no longer a back-room utility language, but a major force in web application creation and systems management,
  and a key driver of the explosion in big data analytics and machine intelligence. </p>

  <h1 class ="heading"> What Python is used for </h1>
  <p class = "paragraph"> The most basic use case for Python is as a scripting and automation language. Python isn’t just
    a replacement for shell scripts or batch files; it is also used to automate interactions with web browsers or application
     GUIs or to do system provisioning and configuration in tools such as Ansible and Salt. But scripting and automation
     represent only the tip of the iceberg with Python.</p>
